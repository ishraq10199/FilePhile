            Services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, MEGA, have revolutionalized
            the file sharing eco-system. But this came at the cost of privacy.
            Your files are at the mercy of some server that is overseas, and if
            you lose access to your account's credentials, gone are your family
            photos, your private documents, and all other things you value. You
            no longer would have the ability to unplug the machine. While there
            exists alternatives for storing your files offline, its not easy to
            host your files with friends and family for free, given that your
            files are large in size.

            This project aims to reduce this reliance on online services that
            are out of your control, and have all your files share-ready with
            your friends and family. Your files should be with you. Not under
            the eyes of a foreign entity.

            Google and other file hosting services allegedly use your data and
            perform analysis on it to train their AI. This is a violation of
            your privacy, and is not to be taken lightly. Your files should be
            yours. Should you not have full reign over how your information gets
            used?

            We do not store any of your data, when you host your files. Your
            files are always private, and stop existing on the web when you want
            it to. This can be scaled to any proportion, depending on what sort
            of storage you have. There are no false promises, no data-mining, no
            AI training using OCR on your information. To ensure that you have
            it all private, all source code is available for you to see.
